## Python Variables - Naming Convention

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number or any special character like $, (, * % etc.
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Python variable names are case-sensitive which means Name and - NAME are two different variables in Python.
- Python reserved keywords cannot be used naming the variable.

### If the name of variable contains multiple words, we should use these naming patterns

- **Camel case** − First letter is a lowercase, but first letter of each subsequent word is in uppercase. For example: kmPerHour, pricePerLitre

- **Pascal case** − First letter of each word is in uppercase. For example: KmPerHour, PricePerLitre

- **Snake case** − Use single underscore (_) character to separate words. For example: km_per_hour, price_per_litre
