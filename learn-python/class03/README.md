## Operators
Types of operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Membership Operators
- Identity Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
```
        a = 10
        b = 20
+	Addition	a + b = 30
-	Subtraction	a â€“ b = -10
*	Multiplication	a * b = 200
/	Division	b / a = 2
%	Modulus	b % a = 0
**	Exponent	a**b =10**20
//	Floor Division	9//2 = 4

```

### Python Comparison Operators
```
==	Equal	(a == b) is not true.
!=	Not equal	(a != b) is true.
>	Greater than	(a > b) is not true.
<	Less than	(a < b) is true.
>=	Greater than or equal to (a >= b) is not true.
<=	Less than or equal to	(a <= b) is true.
```

### Python Assignment Operators
```
=	a = 10	a = 10
+=	a += 30	a = a + 30
-=	a -= 15	a = a - 15
*=	a *= 10	a = a * 10
/=	a /= 5	a = a / 5
%=	a %= 5	a = a % 5
**=	a **= 4	a = a ** 4
//=	a //= 5	a = a // 5

```

### Python Logical Operators
```
**and**	AND	a and b
**or**	OR	a or b
**not**	NOT	not(a)
```

### Python Membership Operators

```
**in**	Returns True if it finds a variable in the specified sequence, false otherwise.	a in b
**not** in	returns True if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.	a not in b
```

### Python Identity Operators
```
**is**	Returns True if both variables are the same object and false otherwise.	a is b
**is not**	Returns True if both variables are not the same object and false otherwise.	a is not b
```
